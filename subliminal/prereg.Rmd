# Study Information

## Title

`r rmarkdown::metadata$title`

## Research questions

We aim to test whether the subliminal cue effect is robust to typical variation in experimental methods that might occur from labratory to labratory. Such variation typifies the sorts of generalizing to the real world. In general, is it the case that subliminal effects can substantively influence behavior?

It may be the case that these effects are restricted to some subset of the space of possible experimental methods. For instance, it may require a particular mask and cue contrast, mask duration, interval duration, and/or mask symbols. We aim to test the finding from (Reuss et al. 2015) that such an effect exists by thoroughly running through the space of all possible experiments.

## Experimental questions

Q1: When (i.e. under which covariates) does the masked cue increase or decrease response times in the target-clicking task?

Q2: When are masked cues are subliminal?

Q3: Is there a set of covariates for which subliminal cues impact target-clicking reaction time?

We will explore the various co-variates in the design and how they impact Q1 and Q2. In particular, we expect significant overlap between explicit (i.e. non-subliminal) cues and cues that impact reaction time in the target-clicking task.

## Data cleaning

In order to ensure that participants are indeed performing the task as specified, we will remove timings less then 250 milliseconds or greater than 2,000 milliseconds. Additionally, because there are likely substantial difference as participants acclimate to the task, we will remove the first trial of each block and the first block.

# Analysis Plan
<!-- You may describe one or more confirmatory analysis in this section. Remember, all analyses specified in this section must be reported in the final article, and any additional analyses must be clearly labeled as exploratory or hypothesis generating in the final paper. A confirmatory analysis plan must state up front which variables are predictors (independent) and which are the outcomes (dependent), otherwise it is an exploratory analysis.

You may describe exploratory analyses in this section, but a clear confirmatory analysis is required. An exploratory test is any test where a prediction is not made up front, or there are multiple possible tests that you are going to use. A statistically significant finding in an exploratory test is a great way to form a new confirmatory hypothesis, which could be registered at a later time.

To help you keep track of multiple analyses, you may label each for your reference. -->

In order to assess whether a covariate impacts reaction times, we will compute Bayesian t-tests. From these analyses, we will get Bayes factors that correspond to the degree of support for (or against) the hypothesis that the covariate impacts reaction times. In order to compute these Bayes factors, we will use a scale r on effect size of 0.707 and Jeffrey-Zellner-Siow (JZS) prior.

In order to assess whether the mask is subliminal or explicit, we compare a null model in which the probability of correctly identifying the masked cue is exactly 50% to an alternative model in which the probability of correctly identifying the masked cue is distributed according to a Beta distribution with rate alpha and scale beta. We use the prior alpha=beta=1 and report the Bayes factor associated with the priors given the data.

## Transformations
<!-- If you plan on transforming, centering, recoding the data, or will require a coding scheme for categorical variables, please describe that process. -->

Since the data associated with stimulus presentation are measured in frames while reactino times are measured in milliseconds, we will convert stimulus presentation to milliseconds in order to standardize the units across the dataset. To do this, the milliseconds (ms) are computed from frames (f) and refresh rate (Hz) via the equation ms = f*1000/Hz.

## Inference criteria
<!-- What criteria will you use to make inferences? Please describe the information you'll use (e.g. p-values, Bayes factors, specific model fit indices), as well as cut-off criterion, where appropriate. Will you be using one or two tailed tests for each of your analyses? If you are comparing multiple conditions or testing multiple hypotheses, will you account for this? -->

Such considerations only make sense in the Neyman-Fisher statistical framework.  We don't make decisions .  Instead, we state the strength of evidence, and no criteria are needed.  See @Rouder:etal:2016c.
